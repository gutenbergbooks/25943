<h2>I</h2>
<h3>THE FIDDLER</h3>
</div>

<p>If Chirpy Cricket had begun to make
music earlier in the summer perhaps he
wouldn&#8217;t have given so much time to fiddling
in Farmer Green&#8217;s farmyard.
Everybody admitted that Chirpy was the
most musical insect in the whole neighborhood.
And it seemed as if he tried his
hardest to crowd as much music as possible
into a few weeks, though he had been
silent enough during all the spring.</p>
<p>He had dug himself a hole in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
ground, under some straw that was scattered
near the barn; and every night, from
midsummer on, he came out and made
merry.</p>
<p>But in the daytime he was usually quiet
as a mouse, sitting inside his hole and doing
nothing at all except to wait patiently
until it should be dark again, so that he
might crawl forth from his hiding place
and take up his music where he had left
it unfinished the night before.</p>
<p>Somehow he always knew exactly where
to begin. Although he carried no sheets
of music with him, he never had to stop
and wonder what note to begin on, for the
reason that he always fiddled on the same
one.</p>
<p>When rude people asked Chirpy Cricket&mdash;as
they did now and then&mdash;why he
didn&#8217;t change his tune, he always replied
that a person couldn&#8217;t change anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
without taking time. And since he expected
to make only a short stay in Pleasant
Valley he didn&#8217;t want to fritter away
any precious moments.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket&#8217;s neighbors soon noticed
that he carried his fiddle with him
everywhere he went. And the curious ones
asked him a question. &#8220;Why&#8221;&mdash;they inquired&mdash;&#8220;why
are you forever taking your
fiddle with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Chirpy Cricket reminded them
that the summer would be gone almost before
anybody knew it. He said that when
he wanted to play a tune he didn&#8217;t intend
to waste any valuable time hunting for his
fiddle.</p>
<p>Now, all that was true enough. But it
was just as true that he couldn&#8217;t have left
his fiddle at home anyhow. Chirpy made
his music with his two wings. He rubbed
a file-like ridge of one on a rough part of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
the other. So his fiddle&mdash;if you could call
it by that name&mdash;just naturally had to go
wherever he did.</p>
<p><i>Cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!</i> When that
shrill sound, all on one note, rang out in
the night everybody that heard it knew
that Chirpy Cricket was sawing out his
odd music. And the warmer the night the
faster he played. He liked warm weather.
Somehow it seemed to make him feel especially
lively.</p>
<p>People who wanted to be disagreeable
were always remarking in Chirpy Cricket&#8217;s
hearing that they hoped there would
be an early frost. They thought of course
he would know they were tired of his music
and wished he would keep still.</p>
<p>But such speeches only made him fiddle
the faster. &#8220;An early frost!&#8221; he would
exclaim. &#8220;I must hurry if I&#8217;m to finish
my summer&#8217;s fiddling.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>Now, Chirpy had dozens and dozens of
relations living in holes of their own, in the
farmyard or the fields. And the gentlemen
were all musical. Like him, they were fiddlers.
Somehow fiddling ran in their family.
So on warm nights, during the last
half of the summer, there was sure to be a
Crickets&#8217; concert.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seemed to Johnnie Green,
who lived in the farmhouse, as if Chirpy
Cricket and his relations were trying to
drown the songs of the musical Frog family,
over in the swamp.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
<h2>II</h2>
<h3>QUICK AND EASY</h3>
</div>

<p>Of course Chirpy Cricket didn&#8217;t spend all
his time merely sitting quietly in his hole,
in the daytime&mdash;and fiddling every night.
Of course he had to eat. And each night
he was in the habit of creeping out of his
hole and gathering spears of grass in
Farmer Green&#8217;s yard, which he carried
home with him.</p>
<p>He called that &#8220;doing his marketing.&#8221;
And it was lucky for him that he liked
grass, there was so much of it to be had.
All he had to do was to step outside his
door; and there it was, all around him!
It made housekeeping an easy matter and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
left him plenty of time, every night, to
fiddle and frolic.</p>
<p>Somehow Chirpy could never go from
one place to another in a slow, sober walk.
He always moved by leaps, as if he felt too
gay to plod along like Daddy Longlegs,
for instance. Chirpy himself often remarked
that he hadn&#8217;t time to move
slowly. And almost before he had finished
speaking, as likely as not he would
jump into the air and alight some distance
away. It was all done so quickly that a
person could scarcely see how it happened.
But Chirpy Cricket said it was as easy as
anything. And having leaped like that,
often he would begin to shuffle his wings
together the moment he landed on the
ground, thereby making his shrill music.</p>
<p>Many of his neighbors declared that he
believed a short life and a merry one was
the best kind. And when they thought of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Timothy Turtle, who was so old that nobody
could even guess his age, and was so
disagreeable and snappish that every one
kept out of his way, the neighbors decided
that possibly Chirpy Cricket&#8217;s way was
the better of the two. Anyhow, there was
no doubt that Timothy Turtle believed in
a long life and a grumpy one.</p>
<p>All Chirpy&#8217;s relations were of the same
mind as he. They acted as if they would
rather make the nights ring with their
music than do anything else. And Johnnie
Green said one evening, when he heard
Solomon Owl hooting over in the hemlock
woods, that it was lucky there weren&#8217;t as
many Owls as there were Crickets in the
valley.</p>
<p>If there were hundreds&mdash;or maybe
thousands&mdash;of Owls, and they all hooted
at the same time, there&#8217;d be no sleeping
for anybody. At least that was Johnnie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
Green&#8217;s opinion. And it does seem a reasonable
one.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket&#8217;s nearest relations all
looked exactly like him. Everybody said
that the Crickets bore a strong family resemblance
to one another. But there were
others&mdash;more distant cousins&mdash;that were
quite unlike Chirpy. There were the Mole
Crickets, who stayed in the ground and
never, never came to the surface; and
there were the Tree Crickets, who lived
in the trees and fiddled <i>re-teat! re-teat
re-teat!</i> until you might have thought
they would get tired of their ditty.</p>
<p>But they never did. They seemed to
like their music as much as Chirpy
Cricket liked his <i>cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!</i></p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
<h2>III</h2>
<h3>THE BUMBLEBEE FAMILY</h3>
</div>

<p>The farmyard was not the first place that
Chirpy Cricket chose for his home. Before
he dug himself a hole under the
straw near the barn he had settled in the
pasture. Although the cows seemed to
think that the grass in the pasture belonged
to them alone, Chirpy decided that
there ought to be enough for him too, if
he didn&#8217;t eat too much.</p>
<p>He had been living in the pasture some
time before he discovered that a very
musical family had come to live next door
to him. They were known as the Bumblebees;
and there were dozens of them huddled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
into a hole long since deserted by
some Woodchucks that had moved to other
quarters.</p>
<p>Although they were said to be great
workers&mdash;most of them!&mdash;the Bumblebee
family found plenty of time to make
music. They were very fond of humming.
And in the beginning Chirpy
Cricket thought their humming a pleasant
sound to hear, as he sat in his dark hole
during the daytime.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re having a party in there!&#8221; he
said, the first time he noticed the droning
music. &#8220;No doubt&#8221;&mdash;he added&mdash;&#8220;no
doubt they&#8217;re enjoying a dance!&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought made him feel so jolly that
if it had only been dark out of doors he
would have left his home and leaped about
in the pasture.</p>
<p>All that day, between naps, Chirpy
could hear the humming. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
a long party!&#8221; he exclaimed, when he
awoke late in the afternoon and heard the
Bumblebee family still making music.
But about sunset their humming stopped.
And Chirpy Cricket couldn&#8217;t help feeling
a bit disappointed, because he had hoped
to enjoy a dance himself, to the Bumblebees&#8217;
music when he left his home that
evening.</p>
<p>A little later he told his favorite cousin
about the party that had lasted all day.
And Chirpy said that he supposed the
Bumblebees had only one party a year,
because he understood that most of them
were great workers, and he didn&#8217;t believe
they would care to spend a whole day humming,
very often.</p>
<p>The favorite cousin gave Chirpy a
strange look in the moonlight. And then
he began to fiddle, making no remark
whatsoever. He thought there was no use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
wasting words on a fine, warm night&mdash;just
the sort of night for a lively <i>cr-r-r-i!
cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!</i></p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket lost no time in getting
his own fiddle to working. And each of
them really believed he was himself making
most of the music that was heard in
the pasture.</p>
<p>Once in a while Chirpy Cricket and his
cousin stopped to eat a little grass, or
paused to carry a few spears into their
holes, because they liked to have something
to nibble on in the daytime. But they
always returned to their fiddling again;
and they never stopped for good until almost
morning.</p>
<p>But at last Chirpy Cricket announced
that he would make no more music that
night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go home now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I expect
to have a good day&#8217;s rest. And I&#8217;ll meet

<h3>TOO MUCH MUSIC</h3>
</div>

<p>It was just beginning to grow light in the
east when Chirpy Cricket crawled into his
hole in the pasture, after his fiddling
with his favorite cousin. Having spent
a good deal of the previous day in listening
to the humming of the musical Bumblebee
family, who lived next door to him,
Chirpy was more than ready to rest.</p>
<p>All was quiet at that hour of the morning,
except for the creaky fiddling of a
relation of Chirpy&#8217;s who didn&#8217;t appear to
know that it was time to go home. But
Chirpy Cricket didn&#8217;t mind that. Fiddling
never bothered him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>He never knew whether he had fallen
asleep or not. He may have been only
day-dreaming. Anyhow, all at once he
noticed a rumbling sound, which grew
louder and louder as he listened.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re at it again!&#8221; Chirpy Cricket
exclaimed. &#8220;The Bumblebee family have
begun their music. I do hope they aren&#8217;t
going to have another all-day party, for
I don&#8217;t want my rest disturbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he soon found that the Bumblebees
were not tuning up for nothing. Before
long they were humming and buzzing
away as if they hadn&#8217;t a care in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare,&#8221;&mdash;Chirpy cried, although
there was no one but himself to hear&mdash;&#8220;I
declare, they&#8217;re dancing again! It can&#8217;t
be long after sunrise, either. And no
doubt they won&#8217;t stop till sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>He began to feel very much upset. He
could understand why people should want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
to make music by night, and hop about in
a lively fashion, too. But by day&mdash;ah! that
was another matter.</p>
<p>Being unable to rest, on account of the
uproar from the Bumblebees&#8217; house,
Chirpy crept out of his door and stood
blinking in the pasture. Soon he noticed
a plump person sitting on a head of clover
which the cows had overlooked. Chirpy
couldn&#8217;t see clearly who he was, coming
up out of the darkness as he had. But
he was glad there was somebody to talk to,
anyhow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning!&#8221; he greeted the person
on the clover-top, adding in a lower
tone, &#8220;They&#8217;re a queer family&mdash;those
Bumblebees!&#8221;</p>
<p>To his great dismay, the person to whom
he had spoken began to buzz. And leaping
nearer him, in order to see him better,
Chirpy Cricket discovered that he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
been talking to Buster Bumblebee! Buster
was a blundering, good-natured chap.
And to Chirpy&#8217;s relief, instead of getting
angry he merely laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt your feelings,&#8221;
Chirpy told him. &#8220;If I&#8217;m disagreeable
this morning, it&#8217;s because I need a good
rest. And your family&#8217;s humming disturbs
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think we&#8217;re queer?&#8221; Buster
asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you call it a bit odd&mdash;having a
dance at this time of day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you! They&#8217;re not dancing in
there!&#8221; Buster Bumblebee cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the workers storing away the honey.
They&#8217;re always buzzing like that. Perhaps
you didn&#8217;t know that our honey-makers
can&#8217;t work without being noisy.
To tell the truth, they wake me every
morning. And often I&#8217;d rather sleep.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will they keep this racket up all summer?&#8221;
Chirpy inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;On all pleasant days!&#8221; Buster Bumblebee
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Chirpy Cricket, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have
to move to a quieter neighborhood. This
humming every day would soon drive me
frantic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; Buster Bumblebee
told him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often felt that way
myself.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
<h2>V</h2>
<h3>A LIGHT IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>

<p>Chirpy Cricket preferred the dark to the
day. He was quite different from Jennie
Junebug and Mehitable Moth, who dearly
loved a light at night, and would dash joyously
into any they saw.</p>
<p>There was only one light that Chirpy
Cricket was always glad to see. He
thought Freddie Firefly&#8217;s flashes looked
very cheerful as they twinkled about the
farmyard. And he often told Freddie that
he would be willing to linger above ground
in the daytime now and then, if only
Freddie would stay with him and make
merry with his light.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>But Freddie Firefly knew enough to decline
the invitation. He was well aware
that nobody could see his light when the
sun was shining. And he was afraid that
other merrymakers in the farmyard might
make matters far from merry for him.
For Freddie Firefly feared all birds. At
night he used his trusty light to frighten
Mr. Nighthawk or Willie Whip-poor-will.
But he didn&#8217;t intend to run any risk in the
daytime, with Jolly Robin or Rusty Wren.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket soon saw that it was useless
to try to get Freddie Firefly to enjoy
an outing with him by daylight. So every
night he spent as much time as he could in
Freddie&#8217;s company.</p>
<p>If the truth were known, Chirpy Cricket
wished that he had a light of his own.
And he couldn&#8217;t help hoping that sooner
or later Freddie Firefly would offer to
lend him his.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>Night after night the two met in the
farmyard. But nothing seemed further
from Freddie Firefly&#8217;s thoughts than
lending his brilliant greenish-white light
to Chirpy Cricket, or to any one else.</p>
<p>But Chirpy simply couldn&#8217;t keep his
eyes off that wonderful flash-light when
Freddie Firefly was in the neighborhood.
People began to notice that he even
stopped fiddling sometimes, to stare at
Freddie Firefly.</p>
<p>At last Chirpy Cricket made up his
mind that if he was ever going to borrow
the light he would have to ask Freddie
for it. Several nights passed before he
could think of a good reason for using it.
But after a while he thought of a fine one.
So he went straight to Freddie Firefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see Miss Christabel
Cricket home after the music is over tonight,&#8221;
Chirpy said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve been wondering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
if you&#8217;d be willing to do me a
favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly!&#8221; Freddie Firefly told
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you loan me your light?&#8221; Chirpy
asked him. &#8220;You know there&#8217;ll be no
moon when it&#8217;s time to go home. And
your light would be a great help to me,
for Miss Christabel lives beyond the barnyard
fence.&#8221;</p>
<p>For just a few moments Freddy Firefly
appeared greatly surprised. To tell the
truth, Chirpy&#8217;s request almost took his
breath away. And while he recovered
himself he forgot to flash his light&mdash;a most
unusual oversight.</p>
<p>But Freddie was no person to disappoint
a friend. Besides, he had just said,
&#8220;Why, certainly!&#8221;</p>
<p>Really, there was nothing for him to do
but to say the same thing again.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>A PLAN GOES WRONG</h3>
</div>

<p>Chirpy Cricket never fiddled faster than
he did that night. Somehow he had a notion
that the faster he fiddled the more
quickly the night would pass. For Freddie
Firefly had promised to loan Chirpy
his light, because Chirpy needed it when
he saw Miss Christabel Cricket to her
home beyond the barnyard fence. Chirpy
was going to see her safely to her door
when the night&#8217;s concert was ended. And
he could hardly wait until the time came
when he would flash that wonderful light
in the eyes of all his friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t go dancing across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
meadow tonight,&#8221; he remarked anxiously
to Freddie Firefly. &#8220;You might wander
into the swamp and get lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s no danger of that!&#8221; Freddie
assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you stumbled into the wet swamp
you might put your light out,&#8221; Chirpy
Cricket warned him.</p>
<p>But Freddie Firefly laughed and told
him not to worry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always enjoy at least one dance in the
meadow each night,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;They&#8217;re expecting me over there now.
And I don&#8217;t want to disappoint them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Chirpy answered. &#8220;And neither
do you want to disappoint me. So please
don&#8217;t fail to be on hand when the music&#8217;s
finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>After telling Chirpy that he wouldn&#8217;t
fail him, Freddie Firefly flitted away.
But in spite of what he had said Chirpy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Cricket couldn&#8217;t help feeling nervous and
uneasy. And he fiddled so fast that the
other fiddlers kept complaining. They
said he wasn&#8217;t playing in time.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket was too well-mannered
to contradict them. But he had his own
opinion, which he kept to himself. He
thought his companions were out of time.
&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; he exclaimed under his
breath. &#8220;I near heard such slow fiddling
in all my life!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was another way, too, in which
Chirpy annoyed the others. He kept asking
them&mdash;first one and then another&mdash;what
time it was. And of course nobody
wants to stop and look at his watch when
he is fiddling.</p>
<p>At last one of his cousins told him, in
answer to his question, that it was time
to stop talking and pay attention to the
music.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>After that Chirpy Cricket tried to be
patient. But it was hard not to be restless.
And he kept leaping into the air,
hoping to get a glimpse of Freddie Firefly&#8217;s
twinkling light. For it seemed to him
that Freddie would never return from the
meadow.</p>
<p>At last the fiddlers stopped playing, one
after another; for the night was going
fast. The Cricket family always liked
to be home before daylight.</p>
<p>Chirpy had almost given up hope of
seeing Freddie Firefly. But to his great
delight Freddie came skipping up just
as Chirpy stood before Miss Christabel
Cricket, whom he expected to see to her
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come!&#8221; Chirpy
greeted him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take your light now.
And I&#8217;ll return it to you to-morrow
night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! That would be too much trouble
for you,&#8221; Freddie Firefly said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
right along with you and your young lady.
And after I&#8217;ve lighted her home I&#8217;ll do
the same thing for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! That would be too much trouble
for you,&#8221; Chirpy Cricket objected. &#8220;Let
me take the light, please!&#8221; He certainly
didn&#8217;t want Freddie Firefly tagging along
with Miss Christabel Cricket and himself.</p>
<p>Of course, Freddie Firefly <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> give
Chirpy his light. It was just as much a
part of him as his head. And since Chirpy
Cricket began to get excited, and said
again and again that the light had been
promised him, in the end Freddie had to
explain everything.</p>
<p>It was a great disappointment to
Chirpy Cricket. He had expected to have
wonderful fun, flashing Freddie Firefly&#8217;s
light.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>But Miss Christabel Cricket did not
seem to mind in the least.</p>
<p>&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to blame Freddie Firefly
for not loaning his light,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
know you wouldn&#8217;t let him take your
fiddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Chirpy Cricket hadn&#8217;t thought
of that. And he had to admit that what
she said was true.</p>
<p>And just then the sun peeped over Blue
Mountain. So everybody hurried home
alone, after all.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>JOHNNIE GREEN&#8217;S GUEST</h3>
</div>

<p>There were enough night noises before
Chirpy Cricket came to live in the farmyard.
What with Solomon Owl&#8217;s hooting,
his cousin Simon Screecher&#8217;s quavering
call, and the musical Frog&#8217;s family&#8217;s concerts
in Cedar Swamp, it was a wonder
that Johnnie Green ever managed to fall
asleep. The Katydids alone were almost
enough to drive anybody frantic&mdash;if he
let himself listen to them&mdash;with their
everlasting cry of <i>Katy did, Katy did; she
did, she did</i>.</p>
<p>Johnnie Green himself said he wished
the Crickets had gone somewhere else to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
spend the summer. At least, he thought
they might play some other tune besides
<i>cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!</i> over and over
again. If they would only fiddle &#8220;Yankee
Doodle&#8221; now and then he said he wouldn&#8217;t
mind lying awake a while to listen to it.</p>
<p>Perhaps Chirpy Cricket heard what
Johnnie Green said. Maybe he wanted to
punish him. Anyhow, he crept into the
farmhouse one evening and found his way
into Johnnie Green&#8217;s chamber, where he
hid in a gaping crack behind the baseboard.
And that very night, as soon as
Johnnie Green put out his light and
jumped into bed, Chirpy Cricket began to
fiddle for him.</p>
<p>Johnnie had been sleepy. But the moment
Chirpy Cricket began fiddling right
there in his room he became wide awake.
He had had no idea how loudly one of the
Cricket family could play his <i>cr-r-r-i!</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
<i>cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!</i> indoors. The high, shrill
sound was piercing. It rang in Johnnie&#8217;s
ears and drowned the muffled concert of
the fields and swamp which the light
breeze bore through the window.</p>
<p>For a few minutes Johnnie lay still.
And then he sat up in bed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to
get up and find that fellow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
I don&#8217;t, he&#8217;ll keep me awake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment he stirred, the fiddling
stopped short. Johnnie was glad of that.
And once more he laid his head upon his
pillow. But in a few moments that
<i>cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!</i> rang out again.</p>
<p>Then Johnnie Green tried several remedies.
He shook the bed. He knocked
over a chair. He caught up a shoe and
threw it toward a corner of the room,
whence the sound seemed to come. And
then he threw the other shoe.</p>
<p>Every time Johnnie Green made a noise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Chirpy Cricket stopped fiddling. And if
Johnnie had had enough shoes no doubt
he could have kept Chirpy from making
any more music that night. But of course
Johnnie couldn&#8217;t have slept any, if he had
done that. Besides, he would have kept
the whole family awake, too. He thought
of that after he had hurled the second
shoe. For his father called up the stairs
and asked him what was the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an old Cricket in my room!&#8221;
Johnnie explained. &#8220;He&#8217;s keeping me
awake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you were keeping him
awake,&#8221; said Farmer Green. &#8220;Get up
and look for him if you must.... But
don&#8217;t let him bite you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t joke if this old Cricket
was in your room,&#8221; Johnnie grumbled.</p>
<p>He did not grumble often. But he had
had a long, hard day, swimming in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
mill-pond and climbing apple trees. And
he wanted to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Johnnie Green thought it was no time to
crack jokes.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<h3>PLEASING JOHNNIE GREEN</h3>
</div>

<p>Johnnie Green knew that he could never
find the Cricket in the dark. So he
crawled out of bed and lighted a candle,
blinking a few moments in its flickering
flame.</p>
<p>From his hiding place in the crack of
the baseboard, in a corner of Johnnie
Green&#8217;s chamber, Chirpy Cricket saw the
gleam of the candle. And he wondered
whether it might be a relation of Freddie
Firefly. It seemed to have a trick of moving
about in a jerky fashion, as if it didn&#8217;t
know where it was going and didn&#8217;t
greatly care, so long as it was on the move.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket kept still as a mouse
then. He soon saw that the bearer of the
bright light was quite unlike Freddie Firefly,
in one way. He made a tremendous
racket, knocking over almost everything
in the room.</p>
<p>In a few minutes a voice called up the
stairway again. &#8220;Is the Cricket chasing
you?&#8221; it asked. It was Farmer Green,
speaking to Johnnie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tease me!&#8221; Johnnie Green cried.
&#8220;Come up and help me find him!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Farmer Green climbed the stairs and
looked into Johnnie&#8217;s room and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I ought to have brought the old
shotgun,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d hate to have a
Cricket jump at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnnie managed to grin at that. He
was so wide awake that he no longer felt
like grumbling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with this Cricket is that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
won&#8217;t jump,&#8221; he told his father. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
tell where he is, because he keeps still
whenever I move. But when the light&#8217;s
out and everything&#8217;s quiet he makes a terrible
noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a trick Crickets have,&#8221; Farmer
Green observed. &#8220;And I must say that if
I were a Cricket I&#8217;d act the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course Chirpy Cricket heard everything
that was said. And he couldn&#8217;t help
thinking that Farmer Green was a very
sensible person. &#8220;I dare say he&#8217;d be a
famous fiddler if he belonged to our family,&#8221;
Chirpy told himself. And for a moment
or two he was tempted to play a tune
for Farmer Green. But he thought better
of the notion at once. He remembered
that Farmer Green had climbed the stairs
to hunt for him. And Chirpy squeezed
himself further into the crack where he
was hiding until he was so huddled up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
that he couldn&#8217;t have fiddled if he had
wanted to.</p>
<p>Though they looked carefully, neither
Johnnie nor his father could find him.
And at last they had to admit that it was
useless to search any longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; Johnnie wailed.
&#8220;As soon as I put out the light and get
into bed he&#8217;ll begin chirping again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In such cases,&#8221; Farmer Green answered
wisely, &#8220;there&#8217;s only one thing to
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Johnnie inquired hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you can do,&#8221; said Farmer Green,
&#8220;is to come downstairs and have something
to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, that may seem a strange remedy.
But somehow it just suited Johnnie
Green. He pattered barefooted down the
stairs. And later, when he went to bed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
again, and Chirpy Cricket began to chirp
once more, all Johnnie Green said was
this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sing away&mdash;little Tommy Tucker!
You may not know it, but you sang for my
supper!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the next moment, Johnnie Green
was sound asleep.</p>

<h3>AN INTERRUPTED NAP</h3>
</div>

<p>Chirpy Cricket liked his home in Farmer
Green&#8217;s yard. During the long summer
days he thought it very cheerful to rest
in his dark hole in the ground. He liked
the darkness of his home; he liked its
warmth, too. For in pleasant weather the
sun beat down upon the straw-littered
ground above him and gave him plenty of
heat, while on gray days the straw blanket
kept his house cosy. And it never occurred
to Chirpy Cricket that there was
anything odd in having a blanket over his
house instead of over himself.</p>
<p>Nothing ever really disturbed Chirpy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
Cricket after he settled in the farmyard.
To be sure, he had a few frights at first.
Now and then the earth trembled in a terrible
fashion. But that happened only
when Johnnie Green led old Ebenezer, or
some other horse, to the watering-trough,
passing right over Chirpy&#8217;s home. And
Chirpy had soon learned that he was in no
danger.</p>
<p>Then at other times he heard an odd
tearing and scratching, as if some giant
had discovered Chirpy&#8217;s doorway and
meant to dig him out of his hiding place.
By peeping slyly out he discovered at last
the cause of those fearful sounds. It was
only the hens looking for something to
eat&mdash;a bit of grain amid the straw, or perhaps
an angleworm. Chirpy never left
his house when he heard the hens at work.
He had no wish to offer himself as a tidbit.
And he felt quite safe down in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
home, for he was quick to learn that the
hens were no diggers. They could only
scratch the surface of the ground. So, in
time, he used to laugh when he heard them.
And now and then he would even fiddle a
bit, as if to say to them, &#8220;Here I am!
Come and get me if you can!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of fiddling, coming from beneath
their feet, always puzzled the hens.
They would stop scratching and cock their
heads on one side, to listen. And they
tried to look very knowing. But they
were really the most stupid of all the creatures
in the farmyard. If they had only
been as wise as Farmer Green&#8217;s cat they
would have kept still and waited and
watched. And sooner or later they would
have given Chirpy Cricket the surprise
of his life, when he came crawling out of
his hole to get a few blades of grass for
his supper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>But even if the hens had thought of such
a plan they never could have kept their
minds upon it long enough to carry it out.
So perhaps it was no wonder that Chirpy
Cricket got the idea into his head that he
was safe from everybody. Sometimes,
when he was dozing, even the footsteps of
old Ebenezer failed to rouse him.</p>
<p>But there came a day when Chirpy
Cricket awoke with a great start. Something
had touched his long feelers. Something
had come right down into his hole
and was prodding him.</p>
<p>He thought it must be a hen. And he
did not laugh. No! Nor did he fiddle!</p>

<h3>CAUGHT!</h3>
</div>

<p>Whatever or whoever it was that had entered
Chirpy Cricket&#8217;s home&mdash;the hole in
the ground near Farmer Green&#8217;s barn&mdash;it
caused him a terrible fright. It kept
poking him in a most alarming fashion.
Chirpy couldn&#8217;t move away from it, for
his home was only big enough for himself
alone. And since he didn&#8217;t care to share it
with another, he soon made up his mind
that there was only one thing for him to
do. He would quit his house for the time
being, with the hope of finding it empty
later. Indeed Chirpy Cricket thought he
would be lucky to escape in safety. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
he scrambled up into the daylight, to be
greeted with a shout and a pounce, both
at the same time. And Chirpy Cricket
saw, too late, that it was a creature much
bigger than a hen that had captured him.
It was Johnnie Green!</p>
<p>Of course Johnnie himself had not entered
Chirpy&#8217;s underground home. What
he had done was merely to run a straw
into the hole where Chirpy lived and prod
him with it until he came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; said Johnnie Green as he
looked at his prisoner, whom he held gingerly
between a finger and a thumb. &#8220;Are
you the rascal that keeps me awake at
night with your everlasting noise?&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket never said a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;You make racket enough every night,&#8221;
Johnnie told him. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you answer
now when you&#8217;re spoken to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Chirpy Cricket made no reply. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
waved his feelers frantically and tried to
jump out of Johnnie Green&#8217;s grasp.
But no matter how fast he moved his six
legs, he couldn&#8217;t get away.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to like me,&#8221; said his
captor finally. &#8220;You don&#8217;t act as if you
wanted to play with me.... What will
you do for me if I let you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>But not a word did Chirpy Cricket say&mdash;not
one single word!</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a queer one,&#8221; Johnnie Green
told him. &#8220;You might fiddle for me, at
least&mdash;though I must say I don&#8217;t care for
the tune you always play. I can get better
music out of a cornstalk fiddle than
I&#8217;ve ever heard from you or any of your
family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, very carefully, Johnnie set
Chirpy Cricket on the ground, with both
his hands cupped closely over him, so he
couldn&#8217;t jump away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, fiddle!&#8221; Johnnie Green cried.
&#8220;Fiddle just once and I&#8217;ll let you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Johnnie Green waited patiently
for what seemed to him a long time, he
heard nothing that sounded the least bit
like fiddling. So at last he peeped between
two fingers to see what the fiddler
was doing. But Johnnie Green couldn&#8217;t
see him. Little by little he lifted his hands.
And to his great surprise there was nothing
under them but grass&mdash;and beneath
the grass a crack in the earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! You&#8217;re a sly one!&#8221; Johnnie
Green exclaimed. &#8220;You&#8217;ve crawled into
that crack. And you may stay there, too,
for all I care.&#8221; Johnnie jumped to his
feet and moved away. And not until he
had been gone some time did Chirpy
Cricket make a sound. Then he played
a few notes on his fiddle, just to see that it
hadn&#8217;t been harmed.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>A QUEER, NEW COUSIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Chirpy Cricket was so fond of fiddling
that sometimes he was the last of all the
big Cricket family to stop making music
and go home to bed. Now and then he
lingered so long above the ground that the
dawn caught him before he crept into his
hole in the ground, beneath the straw.
And one morning it was getting so light
before he had played enough to suit him
that he crawled into a crack in Farmer
Green&#8217;s garden. It looked like a comfortable
place to spend the day. And he
thought it would be foolish for him to do
much travelling at that hour, because there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
was no telling when an early bird might
spy&mdash;and pounce upon&mdash;him.</p>
<p>He found his retreat quite to his liking.
Nothing had happened to disturb his rest.
And if he had only had time to carry a few
blades of grass into the crack, to eat between
naps, Chirpy would have had nothing
to wish for.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, however, a most
unusual thing took place. Chirpy Cricket
noticed a sound as of some one digging.
It grew louder and louder as he listened.
And it was not in the least like the scratching
of a hen, looking for grubs and worms.
This noise was deep down in the ground
and like nothing Chirpy had ever heard.</p>
<p>He wished that he had not allowed himself
to become so fond of fiddling. If he
had cared less for it, he would have gone
home in good season. But there he was
in a crack in the garden! And he didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
dare leave it because he had heard that the
garden was a famous place for birds.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket was frightened. And
when at last the loose earth near him began
to quiver and even to crumble he was
so scared that he didn&#8217;t know which way
to move. The next instant a strange looking
person stood before him. And for a
few moments neither one of them said a
word.</p>
<p>The newcomer was a big fellow, very
long and with enormous legs. His front
legs especially were short and powerful,
with huge feet at the end of them. And
yet, odd as the stranger was, Chirpy could
not help noticing that somehow he had a
look like the Cricket family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the stranger at last, &#8220;you
seem surprised. Perhaps you weren&#8217;t expecting
callers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Chirpy Cricket answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
in a voice that was faint from the
fright he had had.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re glad to see me, I hope,&#8221; the
stranger went on. &#8220;You know I&#8217;m related
to you. You know I&#8217;m a sort of cousin of
yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; Chirpy Cricket cried. &#8220;I
did think for a moment that there was a
slight family resemblance. But the longer
I look at you the queerer you seem. May
I ask your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mr. Mole Cricket,&#8221; said the
stranger. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t need to inquire
who you are. You&#8217;re one of the well-known
Field Cricket family.&#8221;</p>

<h3>AN UNDERGROUND CHAT</h3>
</div>

<p>Chirpy Cricket was glad of one thing.
Mr. Mole Cricket <i>talked</i> quite pleasantly,
for all he looked so frightful. When he
dug his way through the dirt in Farmer
Green&#8217;s garden and broke into the crack
where Chirpy was hiding he had given
Chirpy a terrible start.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a cousin of mine&mdash;as you
say&mdash;it&#8217;s strange that I&#8217;ve never happened
to meet you before,&#8221; Chirpy told
the newcomer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all! Not at all!&#8221; Mr. Mole
Cricket said. &#8220;I spend all my time underground.
I&#8217;ve never been up in the open.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go out at night?&#8221; Chirpy
asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; Mr. Mole Cricket declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve lived my whole life in the dirt. And
I like it too well to leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket thought his cousin was
the queerest person he had ever met.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you get anything to eat?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>
<p>Mr. Mole Cricket seemed to consider
that an odd question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;There&#8217;s
everything to eat in the ground&mdash;everything
anybody could possibly want.
Wherever I tunnel I find tender roots.
You know Farmer Green grows fine vegetables
here. Indeed that&#8217;s one reason I
live under his garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s one reason, what&#8217;s another?&#8221;
Chirpy Cricket asked him. For Chirpy
couldn&#8217;t help being curious about this new-found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
cousin of his, who had such strange
ways and who was even stranger to look
upon.</p>
<p>He was obliging enough&mdash;was Mr. Mole
Cricket. He was quite willing to answer
any and all questions. It may be that he
was glad of the chance to talk with somebody.
Certainly it seemed to Chirpy
Cricket that his cousin led a very lonely
life. He explained to Chirpy that it was
easy to dig in the garden, because its soil
was loose. The ploughing in the spring,
and the harrowing, as well as the hoeing
that Farmer Green&#8217;s hired man did during
the summer, kept the earth in fine condition
for tunnelling. Of course, living
beneath the surface as he did, Mr. Mole
Cricket had no way of knowing why the
garden soil was so nicely stirred up. He
only knew that it was so. And that was
quite enough for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket said that it was all very
interesting to hear about. But he knew
that he shouldn&#8217;t care to follow Mr. Mole
Cricket&#8217;s manner of living. &#8220;I love to
fiddle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I simply must go
abroad every pleasant night and make
music.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t need to leave the dirt to
fiddle!&#8221; Mr. Mole Cricket exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m musical too. I often fiddle down in
my house. I don&#8217;t know a better way of
passing the time, when a person&#8217;s not
digging or eating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you play for me now?&#8221; Chirpy
Cricket asked him.</p>
<p>Mr. Mole Cricket was more than willing
to oblige. He began to fiddle at once. And
the tune he played was as strange as he
was. Chirpy Cricket did not like it at all.
It seemed to him very mournful, a sort
of sad, sad air, as if Mr. Mole Cricket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
were bewailing his dismal life beneath the
garden.</p>
<p>But of course Chirpy was too polite to
tell that to his cousin. And when Mr.
Mole Cricket asked him how he liked the
tune, Chirpy replied that it was very, very
interesting.</p>

<h3>A QUESTION OF FEET</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you&#8217;re a cousin of mine?&#8221;
Chirpy Cricket inquired of Mr. Mole
Cricket. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that perhaps
you are mistaken? I&#8217;m almost certain
you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Mr. Mole Cricket. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
be wrong. Why do you ask me such a
question?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your forefeet&#8221;&mdash;Chirpy told him&mdash;&#8220;your
forefeet are so big! I&#8217;ve always
understood that all our family had small
ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Mole Cricket smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let the size of my feet trouble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
you!&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t be a Mole
Cricket if my feet were like yours. You
see, I use my forefeet for digging. And
if they weren&#8217;t big and strong I never
could burrow in this garden, nor anywhere
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Chirpy Cricket had his doubts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m inclined to believe,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;that you&#8217;re related to Grandfather Mole,
and not to me. For your feet are very
much like his.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; Mr. Mole Cricket cried.
&#8220;And for pity&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t ever let Grandfather
Mole hear you say that! He&#8217;d be
so angry that he&#8217;d eat me, as likely as not.
You see, he objects to my name. He says
I have no right to call myself Mr. Mole
Cricket. But that&#8217;s the name my family
has always had. And I can&#8217;t very well
change it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The poor fellow acted so alarmed that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
Chirpy Cricket hastened to promise him
that he would never mention his likeness
to Grandfather Mole again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well!&#8221; said Mr. Mole Cricket.
&#8220;That&#8217;s kind of you, I&#8217;m sure. And now,
if you want to make me quite happy,
there&#8217;s one more thing to which you will
agree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Chirpy Cricket asked.
He felt sorry for Mr. Mole Cricket, who
had never known the pleasure of fiddling
with a thousand other musicians under the
stars on a warm summer night. &#8220;If there
is anything I can do to make you happy,
just tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then call me &#8216;Cousin&#8217;!&#8221; Mr. Mole
Cricket begged him.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket cast one glance at Mr.
Mole Cricket&#8217;s huge feet. In spite of
everything their owner had told him,
Chirpy still found it difficult to believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
that Mr. Mole Cricket could be even a very
distant relation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;If it will
make you any happier I&#8217;ll call you &#8216;Cousin&#8217;&mdash;though
you can&#8217;t be any nearer than
a hundred times removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was easy to see that Mr. Mole Cricket
was delighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you! Thank you!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;But permit me to correct you.
I&#8217;m your cousin a good many thousand
times removed. But that&#8217;s no reason why
we shouldn&#8217;t be the best of friends. And
now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;won&#8217;t you come home
with me? I&#8217;d like you to meet my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>While thanking him for the invitation,
Chirpy Cricket couldn&#8217;t help wondering
whether Mr. Mole Cricket&#8217;s wife had as
big feet as her husband.</p>

<h3>CHIRPY IS CAREFUL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Do you live near-by?&#8221; Chirpy Cricket
inquired of Mr. Mole Cricket, who had
just invited him to his home to meet his
wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;My home is not very far from here,&#8221;
his new cousin said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go back
through this tunnel I&#8217;ve been making.
The other end of it opens into my dwelling,
some distance below the surface of
the garden. Follow me and you&#8217;ll have no
trouble finding it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But somehow Chirpy Cricket did not
quite like the idea of travelling with the
stranger, cousin though he might be, under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
Farmer Green&#8217;s garden. &#8220;Not to-day!&#8221;
he said politely. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had anything
to eat since last night. And I don&#8217;t feel
like taking a journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll snatch a bite on the way to my
house,&#8221; Mr. Mole Cricket suggested cheerfully.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll dig out a few juicy roots for
you. Which kind do you like best&mdash;beet,
turnip or carrot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like any of them,&#8221; Chirpy
Cricket confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t!&#8221; his cousin cried, as if he
were astonished to hear that. &#8220;What do
you live on, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grass!&#8221; Chirpy answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of it,&#8221; said Mr. Mole
Cricket. &#8220;And I must say you have queer
tastes&mdash;even though you are my own
cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket saw that he and Mr.
Mole Cricket were bound to have trouble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
if they saw too much of each other. So
he hinted&mdash;in a delicate way&mdash;that Mr.
Mole Cricket&#8217;s wife must be wondering
where he was.</p>
<p>Thereupon that gentleman started up
hurriedly and made for his tunnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you again sometime,&#8221; he said
hastily over his shoulder. And in another
instant he was gone.</p>
<p>They never met again. Chirpy Cricket
took great pains never to spend another
day in hiding in Farmer Green&#8217;s garden.
He was afraid there might be trouble if
he saw more of his cousin. And he
couldn&#8217;t forget those powerful forelegs
and enormous feet of Mr. Mole Cricket!
They looked very dangerous.</p>
<p>The longer Chirpy pondered over his
brief meeting with Mr. Mole Cricket, the
more firmly he made up his mind that he
had been in great danger and that he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
been lucky to escape alive. Everybody
knew that Grandfather Mole was a terrible-tempered
person when aroused. He
would rush at anybody, big or little. Perhaps
that was because he couldn&#8217;t see what
sized person he was attacking. For
Grandfather Mole was blind. But he
never stopped to inquire of anybody
whether he was tall or short, thick or thin.
He just went ahead without asking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; thought Chirpy, &#8220;that I
didn&#8217;t go home with Mr. Mole Cricket.
If his wife&#8217;s feet are anything like his
they&#8217;d be a fearful pair to quarrel with.
And even if they hadn&#8217;t quarrelled with
me, they might have had trouble between
themselves. And if I happened to get in
their way it would certainly have gone
hard with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harmless Mr. Mole Cricket never knew
what a monster his cousin Chirpy Cricket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
believed him to be. When he reached home
he told his wife that he had met a queer
little cousin who spent much of his time
above ground and lived on grass.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Mole Cricket wouldn&#8217;t believe
him. She told him not to be silly. She
even said that there wasn&#8217;t any such thing
as grass. And she asked him how anybody
could live on it when there wasn&#8217;t
any anywhere.</p>
<p>Naturally, she wouldn&#8217;t have talked like
that if she had ever seen much of the
world. But she had spent her whole life
down in the dirt, beneath Farmer Green&#8217;s
garden.</p>

<h3>TOMMY TREE CRICKET</h3>
</div>

<p>After meeting that odd Mr. Mole Cricket,
who claimed to be his cousin, Chirpy
Cricket tried to find out more about him
from his nearer relations. But there
wasn&#8217;t one that had ever seen or heard of
such a person. One night Chirpy even
travelled quite a distance to call on
Tommy Tree Cricket, with the hope that
perhaps Tommy might be able to tell him
something.</p>
<p>Chirpy found Tommy Tree Cricket in
the tangle of raspberry bushes beyond the
garden. It was not hard to tell where he
was, because he was a famous fiddler. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
played a tune that was different from
Chirpy&#8217;s <i>cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!</i>
Tommy Tree Cricket fiddled <i>re-teat! re-teat!
re-teat!</i> And many considered him
a much finer musician than Chirpy himself.
He was small and pale. Beside
Chirpy Cricket, who was all but black,
Tommy Tree Cricket looked decidedly
delicate. But he could fiddle all night
without getting tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come all the way from the yard to
have a chat with you!&#8221; Chirpy called to
his cousin Tommy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up and have a seat!&#8221; said
Tommy Tree Cricket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can find one here, thank you!&#8221;
Chirpy answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Don&#8217;t sit on the damp ground!&#8221;
Tommy cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s a dangerous thing
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket smiled to himself. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
a way Tommy Tree Cricket was queer.
He always clung to trees and shrubs,
claiming that it was much more healthful
to live off the ground. But he was so
pale that Chirpy Cricket was sure he was
mistaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ground&#8217;s good enough for me,&#8221;
Chirpy told his cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t quarrel about that tonight,&#8221;
said Tommy Tree Cricket. &#8220;Sit
there, if you will. And when I&#8217;ve finished
playing this tune we&#8217;ll have a talk. I only
hope you won&#8217;t catch cold while you&#8217;re
waiting down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you stop fiddling long enough to
talk with me now?&#8221; Chirpy asked him.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve come here to ask you whether you
ever saw a cousin of ours called Mr. Mole
Cricket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Re-teat! re-teat! re-teat!</i>&#8221; Tommy
Tree Cricket was already fiddling away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
as if it were the last night of the summer.
He was making so much shrill music that
he couldn&#8217;t hear a word Chirpy said. The
more Chirpy tried to attract his attention
the harder he played, rolling his eyes in
every direction&mdash;except that of his caller.</p>
<p>Several times Chirpy Cricket leaped
into the air, hoping that Tommy Tree
Cricket would see that he had something
important to say. But Tommy paid not
the slightest heed to him.</p>
<p>At last Chirpy decided that he might as
well do a little fiddling himself, to pass
the time away. So he began his <i>cr-r-r-i!
cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!</i> And then Tommy noticed
him immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re playing the wrong tune!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s <i>re-teat! re-teat! re-teat!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket thought that his cousin&#8217;s
face was slightly darker, as if a flush of
annoyance had come over it. He certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
didn&#8217;t want to quarrel with Tommy Tree
Cricket. So he said to him, very mildly,
&#8220;I fear you do not like my playing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that I do,&#8221; said Tommy.
&#8220;It makes me think of that creaking pump
at the farmhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And of what&#8221;&mdash;Chirpy Cricket stammered&mdash;&#8220;of
what, pray, does your own
fiddling remind you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;My own music is
like nothing in the world except the sound
of a shimmering moonbeam.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Tommy Tree
Cricket thought very well of his own fiddling.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>
<h3>A LONG WAIT</h3>
</div>

<p>Chirpy cricket was so good-natured that
he wouldn&#8217;t quarrel with his cousin,
Tommy Tree Cricket. Although Tommy
had said bluntly that Chirpy&#8217;s fiddling reminded
him of Farmer Green&#8217;s creaking
pump, Chirpy made no disagreeable answer.
He did not want to hurt his pale
cousin&#8217;s feelings.</p>
<p>After making his rude remark Tommy
Tree Cricket began his <i>re-teat! re-teat!
re-teat!</i> once more. He shuffled his wings
together at a faster rate than ever, as if
he had to furnish all the music for the
night. As before, he seemed to have forgotten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
all about his caller; for Chirpy still
waited beneath the raspberry bush where
Tommy Tree Cricket was fiddling.</p>
<p>But if Tommy paid no heed to Chirpy,
there was a reason why. Near Tommy sat
a pale young miss of his own sort, who
listened with great enjoyment to his playing.
Or at least she acted as if she thought
it the most beautiful music in the whole
world.</p>
<p>Tommy Tree Cricket was not so intent
upon his fiddling that he couldn&#8217;t roll his
eyes towards his fair listener. And
Chirpy was not slow to understand that it
was for her that Tommy was playing his
<i>re-teat! re-teat! re-teat!</i></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait here until he rests,&#8221; Chirpy
said to himself. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll ask him again
what he knows about Mr. Mole Cricket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Chirpy waited and waited. But
it seemed to him that as the night lengthened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Tommy Tree Cricket fiddled all the
faster. And if the weather hadn&#8217;t turned
colder along toward morning probably he
wouldn&#8217;t have had a chance to speak to
Tommy again.</p>
<p>Anyhow, a cool wind began to whip
around the side of Blue Mountain and
sweep through Pleasant Valley. And the
moment it struck Tommy Tree Cricket
he began to play more slowly. Little by
little a longer pause crept between his
<i>re-teats</i>. And at last the pale miss beside
him cried, &#8220;I hope you&#8217;re not going
to stop your beautiful fiddling!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear I&#8217;ll have to,&#8221; Tommy told her
with a sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to feel a
bit stiff, with this north wind blowing on
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was Chirpy Cricket&#8217;s chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Will you listen
to me a moment?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What! Have you come back again?&#8221;
Tommy Tree Cricket sang out.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I&#8217;ve been here all the time,&#8221;
Chirpy explained. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for
hours to have a talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well!&#8221; Tommy answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s
too cold for me to fiddle any more. So
talk away! And you&#8217;d better be quick
about it, for the night&#8217;s almost gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>But somehow Chirpy Cricket felt that
his chat could wait a little longer. If the
pale young person clinging to the raspberry
bush near Tommy Tree Cricket
loved music, he thought it was a pity to
disappoint her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may feel too cold to fiddle; but
I don&#8217;t!&#8221; Chirpy said. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite warm
down here on the ground. This little hollow
where I&#8217;m sitting is sheltered from
the wind. So I&#8217;ll fiddle for your friend.&#8221;
As he spoke he began to play.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>Looks as of great pain came over the
pale faces of his two listeners in the raspberry
bush. And they shuddered so violently
that they had to cling tightly to their
seats to keep from falling.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend thanks you. But she says
she doesn&#8217;t care for your fiddling,&#8221;
Tommy Tree Cricket called down to
Chirpy. &#8220;She says it&#8217;s too squeaky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket was fiddling so hard by
that time that he never heard a word. And
when he stopped at last, to rest a bit, a
voice cried out, &#8220;That&#8217;s fine! Won&#8217;t you
play some more?&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket was pleased. He
thought, of course, that it was Tommy&#8217;s
friend speaking to him. But when he
looked up he couldn&#8217;t see her anywhere&mdash;nor
her companion either.</p>
<p>They had both disappeared. And it was
already gray in the east.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
<h2>XVII</h2>
<h3>SITTING ON A LILY-PAD</h3>
</div>

<p>Though Chirpy Cricket looked all around
with great care, he couldn&#8217;t discover who
had spoken to him. A voice from somewhere
had called out that his music was
fine and asked him if he wouldn&#8217;t play
some more.</p>
<p>Whoever the owner of the voice might
be, it was plain that he liked music. So
without knowing for whom he was playing,
Chirpy began to fiddle again. And
when he stopped the same voice cried,
&#8220;Thank you very much!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the duck-pond was near-by. And
at first Chirpy hadn&#8217;t thought of looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
there for his listener. But the second
time he heard the voice he guessed that it
came from the pond. So Chirpy leaped
to the water&#8217;s edge; and there, sitting on
a lily-pad, was the tiniest Frog he had ever
seen. He seemed no bigger than Chirpy
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do!&#8221; Chirpy said to him.
&#8220;Was it you that spoke to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; the stranger said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
enjoying your music. And I&#8217;m glad to
meet you. It&#8217;s time we knew each other,
living as we do in the same neighborhood.
My name is Mr. Cricket Frog. And may
I inquire what yours is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m called Chirpy Cricket,&#8221; said the
fiddler on the bank. &#8220;Is it possible&mdash;do
you think&mdash;that we are cousins?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Mr. Cricket Frog. &#8220;No!
I belong to a branch of the well-known
Tree Frog family. But somehow I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
never cared to live in trees. Indeed, I&#8217;ve
never climbed a tree in all my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sensible person!&#8221; Chirpy
Cricket cried. He did not know that the
reason why Mr. Cricket Frog stayed on
the ground was because his feet were not
suited to climbing trees. He couldn&#8217;t have
got up a tree if he had tried. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
afraid of falling off that lily-pad into the
water?&#8221; Chirpy asked his new friend.
&#8220;It seems to me you haven&#8217;t picked out a
safe place at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when
he had a great fright. For Mr. Cricket
Frog did not answer him. Instead he
leaped suddenly into the air. And Chirpy
Cricket feared that he would fall into the
water and be drowned. But when Mr.
Cricket Frog came down again he landed
squarely upon another lily-pad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I caught him,&#8221; he said pleasantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket had no idea what he
was talking about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom did you catch?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fly!&#8221; Mr. Cricket Frog replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you took a great risk,
leaping above the water like that?&#8221;
Chirpy inquired. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you worried
for fear you&#8217;ll fall into the pond some day,
if you jump for flies in that careless fashion?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Cricket Frog tried not to smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I spend
half my time in the water. Please don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;m boasting when I say I&#8217;m a fine
swimmer. You&#8217;ll understand why when
you look at my feet.&#8221; And he held up a
foot so that Chirpy Cricket might see it.</p>
<p>Chirpy noticed that there were webs between
Mr. Cricket Frog&#8217;s toes. And
everybody knows that webbed feet are the
best for swimming.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>Mr. Cricket Frog wanted to be agreeable.
&#8220;Would you like to see me swim?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you!&#8221; Chirpy replied.</p>
<p>So Mr. Cricket Frog leaped nimbly
into the water and began to swim among
the lily-pads while Chirpy watched him
and admired his skill.</p>
<p>All at once Chirpy heard a splash. And
he was just about to ask Mr. Cricket Frog
what it could be, when he noticed something
queer about his new friend. He was
no longer swimming. He was floating, motionless,
upon the water. Not by a single
movement of any kind did he show that
he was alive.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>
<h3>MR. CRICKET FROG&#8217;S TRICK</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Are you hurt?&#8221;
Chirpy Cricket called to Mr. Cricket Frog
from the bank of the duck-pond. Ever
since a splash near-by had interrupted
their talk, Mr. Cricket Frog had not swum
a single stroke. He was floating, motionless,
upon the surface of the water. And
he made no reply whatever to Chirpy&#8217;s
questions. He acted exactly as if he had
not heard them. The fitful breeze caught
at Mr. Cricket Frog&#8217;s limp form and
wafted it about.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket couldn&#8217;t help being
alarmed. And yet he almost thought, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
a moment, that he saw Mr. Cricket Frog&#8217;s
eyes rolling in his direction, as he stood
on the bank of the pond. If Mr. Cricket
Frog was in trouble, Chirpy knew of no
way to help him. And after a time he
made up his mind that Mr. Cricket Frog
was beyond anybody&#8217;s help. Chirpy was
about to go back to the farmyard when Mr.
Cricket Frog came suddenly to life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meet me here to-morrow!&#8221; he called.
Then he dived to the bottom of the water.
And Chirpy Cricket went home, thinking
that it was all very queer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to you yesterday?&#8221;
Chirpy asked Mr. Cricket Frog, when he
came back to the duck-pond the following
day and found that spry little gentleman
waiting for him on a lily-pad. &#8220;Were you
ill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; Mr. Cricket Frog answered.
&#8220;When I heard a splash behind me I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
didn&#8217;t know who made it. So I played
dead for a while. And after waiting until
I felt somewhat safer, I went down to the
bottom of the pond and hid in the mud.
I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s always wise to attract
as little attention as possible when I don&#8217;t
know who&#8217;s lurking about.... I hope
you didn&#8217;t think I was rude,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Chirpy told him. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve
been upset ever since I saw you. I haven&#8217;t
had the heart to fiddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; Mr. Cricket Frog cried.
&#8220;I must do something to cheer you up.
I&#8217;ll sing you a song!&#8221; Then Mr. Cricket
Frog puffed out his yellow throat and began
to sing. And he gave Chirpy Cricket
a great surprise. For his singing was so
like Chirpy&#8217;s fiddling that Chirpy thought
for a moment he was making the sound
himself.</p>
<p>But there was one marked difference.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
Mr. Cricket Frog&#8217;s time was not like his.
It was not regular. Mr. Cricket Frog began
to sing somewhat slowly and gradually
sang faster and faster. After he had
sung about thirty notes he would pause
to get his breath. And then he would begin
again, exactly as before.</p>
<p>Mr. Cricket Frog hadn&#8217;t sung long before
Chirpy&#8217;s spirits began to rise. Indeed,
he soon felt so cheerful that he began
to fiddle. And between the two they
made such a chirping that an old drake
swam across the duck-pond to see what
was going on.</p>
<p>Of course, his curiosity put an end to
the concert. Mr. Cricket Frog saw him
coming. And this time he didn&#8217;t stop to
play dead. He sank in a great hurry to
the bottom of the pond.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket wondered why his friend
chose to stay in a place where there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
so many interruptions. &#8220;I should think,&#8221;
he said to himself, &#8220;Mr. Cricket Frog
would rather live in a hole in the ground,
as I do.... I must ask him, when I see
him again, why he doesn&#8217;t move to the
farmyard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Cricket Frog was very polite, later,
when Chirpy spoke to him about moving.
But he explained that he was too fond of
swimming to do that. And besides, he
thought his voice sounded better on water
than it did on land.</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>
<h3>IT WASN&#8217;T THUNDER</h3>
</div>

<p>Quite often, during the nightly concerts
in which Chirpy Cricket took part, he had
noticed an odd cry, <i>Peent! Peent!</i> which
seemed to come from the woods. And
sometimes there followed from the same
direction a hollow, booming sound, as if
somebody were amusing himself by blowing
across the bung-hole of an empty barrel.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket had a great curiosity to
know who made those queer noises. He
asked everybody he met about them. And
at last Kiddie Katydid told him that it
was Mr. Nighthawk that he had heard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to think he&#8217;s a musician,&#8221;
said Chirpy Cricket. &#8220;But I must say I
don&#8217;t care much for his music. He&#8217;s not
what you might call a steady player. And
his notes are not shrill enough for my liking.
Perhaps he lacks training. I&#8217;d be
glad to take him in hand and see what I
could do with him. Tell me! Does he ever
visit our neighborhood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not often!&#8221; said Kiddie Katydid. &#8220;I
met him here once. And that was enough
for me. I never felt more uncomfortable
in all my life.&#8221; He shuddered as he spoke
and looked over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Somehow Chirpy Cricket did not share
Kiddie Katydid&#8217;s uneasiness. The more
he thought about Mr. Nighthawk the more
he wanted to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ever see Mr. Nighthawk again
I wish you&#8217;d tell him I want to talk with
him,&#8221; Chirpy said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do so,&#8221; Kiddie Katydid promised.
&#8220;And now let me give you a bit of advice.
When you meet Mr. Nighthawk, keep
perfectly still. He&#8217;s a hungry fellow, always
on the look-out for somebody to eat.
But he has one peculiar habit: he won&#8217;t
grab you unless you&#8217;re moving through
the air. He always takes his food on the
wing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy thanked his friend Kiddie Katydid
for this valuable bit of news. And he
said he&#8217;d be sure to remember it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Kiddie Katydid observed, &#8220;if
you forget it when you meet Mr. Nighthawk
you&#8217;ll forget it only once. For he&#8217;ll
grab you quick as a flash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket pondered a good deal
over the talk he had with Kiddie Katydid.
It was clear that Mr. Nighthawk was a
dangerous person. &#8220;Perhaps&#8221;&mdash;Chirpy
thought&mdash;&#8220;perhaps if I could get him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
take a greater interest in his music he
wouldn&#8217;t be so ferocious. Yes! I feel
sure that if I could only persuade him to
practice that booming sound it would give
Mr. Nighthawk something pleasant to
think of. Who knows but that he might
become as gentle as I am?&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket liked that notion so
much that he thought of little else. He
even began to consider making a journey
to the woods where Mr. Nighthawk lived,
in order to meet that gentleman and offer
to train him to be a better musician. And
at last Chirpy had even decided to go&mdash;as
soon as the moon should be full. He spent
much of his time listening for Mr. Nighthawk&#8217;s
<i>Peent! Peent!</i> which now and then
came faintly across the meadow, and the
dull, muffled <i>boom</i> that often followed.</p>
<p>While Chirpy waited for the moon to
grow full, one night an odd thing happened.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
The stars twinkled overhead.
There wasn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky. Yet all
at once a loud <i>boom</i> startled Chirpy
Cricket and made him leap suddenly towards
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; he cried to Kiddie Katydid,
who happened to be near him. &#8220;Did
you hear the thunder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t thunder,&#8221; Kiddie said.
&#8220;And you&#8217;d better not jump like that
again. Mr. Nighthawk is here. He made
that sound himself.&#8221;</p>

<h3>BOUND TO BE DIFFERENT</h3>
</div>

<p>Nothing ever surprised Chirpy Cricket
more than what Kiddie Katydid told him.
He had thought it was thunder that he
had just heard. But it was Mr. Nighthawk,
making that odd, booming sound of
his. It was ever so much louder than
Chirpy had supposed it could be. He had
never heard it so near before.</p>
<p>For a moment Chirpy thought that perhaps
Kiddie Katydid didn&#8217;t know what
he was talking about. But no! There
was Mr. Nighthawk&#8217;s well-known call,
<i>Peent! Peent!</i> There was no denying that
it was his voice. He always talked through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
his nose&mdash;or so it sounded. And one
couldn&#8217;t mistake it.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket began to think that after
all he would rather not have a talk with
Mr. Nighthawk. He certainly sounded
terrible!</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Nighthawk alighted in
a tree right over Chirpy&#8217;s head, and settled
himself lengthwise along a limb. He
was, indeed, an odd person. He liked to
be different from other folk. And just
because other birds sat crosswise on a
perch, Mr. Nighthawk had to sit in exactly
the opposite fashion. No doubt if
he could have, he would have hung underneath
the limb by his heels, like Benjamin
Bat. Only he would have wanted to hang
by his nose instead of his heels, in order
to be different.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has anybody seen Chirpy Cricket?&#8221;
Mr. Nighthawk sang out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on the ground, under that tree
you&#8217;re in,&#8221; Kiddie Katydid informed him.
Kiddie never moved as he spoke, but clung
closely to a twig in the bush where he was
hiding. Being green himself, he hardly
thought that Mr. Nighthawk would be
able to discover him amongst shrubbery
of the same color.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket wished that Kiddie
Katydid hadn&#8217;t replied to Mr. Nighthawk
at all. But how could Kiddie know that
Chirpy had changed his mind? And now
Mr. Nighthawk spoke to Chirpy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see you very well, Mr. Cricket,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you leap into the air a
few times, so I can get a good look at you?
I&#8217;ve heard that you&#8217;ve been wanting to
meet me. And I&#8217;ve come all the way from
the woods just to please you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily Chirpy Cricket did not forget
Kiddie Katydid&#8217;s advice. Kiddie had explained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
to him how Mr. Nighthawk caught
his meals on the wing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to excuse me,&#8221; Chirpy told
Mr. Nighthawk. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not do any
jumping for you. That wasn&#8217;t why I
wanted to meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said Mr. Nighthawk. &#8220;Then
why&mdash;pray&mdash;did you wish to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought&#8221;&mdash;Chirpy Cricket replied&mdash;&#8220;I
thought that perhaps you&#8217;d like me to
help you with your music. I&#8217;ve often
heard your booming at a distance. And it
has seemed to me that you have the making
of a good musician, if you have a good
teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Nighthawk sniffed. It must be remembered
that he was not very gentlemanly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had plenty of training,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come all the way from the woods
to be told that I don&#8217;t know my own business.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
I practice every night. And I flatter
myself that I&#8217;m a perfect performer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Chirpy Cricket, &#8220;perhaps
you need a new fiddle. For there&#8217;s
no doubt that your booming would sound
much better if it were shriller.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Nighthawk gave a rude laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t make that sound with a fiddle,&#8221;
he sneered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know a
wind instrument when you hear it?&#8221;</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>
<h3>MR. NIGHTHAWK EXPLAINS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Nighthawk appeared to think it a
great joke on Chirpy Cricket, because
Chirpy had thought he played the fiddle.
He laughed in a most disagreeable fashion.
And he kept repeating that people
who didn&#8217;t know a wind instrument when
they heard it couldn&#8217;t know much about
music.</p>
<p>As for Chirpy, he didn&#8217;t know just what
to say. But at last he managed to stammer
that he hoped he hadn&#8217;t offended Mr.
Nighthawk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all!&#8221; Mr. Nighthawk told him.
&#8220;This is the funniest thing I&#8217;ve heard for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
a long time. It was worth coming all the
way from the woods to enjoy a laugh over
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course it was very rude for Mr.
Nighthawk to speak in such a way. But
he was never polite to any of the smaller
field-people, unless he happened to be
coaxing them to jump, so that he might
grab them when they were in the air. You
may be sure he was as meek as he could
be if he happened to meet Solomon Owl.
But at that moment Solomon was far off
in the hemlock woods. Only a short time
before Mr. Nighthawk had heard his rolling
call in the distance. So he felt quite
safe in bullying so gentle a creature as
Chirpy Cricket.</p>
<p>Thinking that he ought to be polite to
his caller, rude as he was, Chirpy asked
Mr. Nighthawk if he wouldn&#8217;t kindly play
something.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if I do,&#8221; said Mr. Nighthawk&mdash;meaning
that he <i>did</i> care, and that
he <i>would</i> play something. But it was not
because he wanted to oblige anybody. He
was proud of his booming. And he was
only too glad of a chance to show Chirpy
Cricket how loud he could make it sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay right there in that tree, if you
will!&#8221; Chirpy said. &#8220;I won&#8217;t move. I&#8217;ll
sit here and listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha!&#8221; Mr. Nighthawk laughed. &#8220;I
<i>knew</i> you didn&#8217;t know anything about
wind instruments. When I make that
booming sound I&#8217;m always on the wing.
I&#8217;m going to take a flight now. And when
I come back you&#8217;ll hear a noise that is a
noise&mdash;and not a squeaky chirp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Nighthawk left his perch
and climbed up into the sky. And when
he had risen high enough to suit him he
dropped like a stone. It seemed to Chirpy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
Cricket that he had never heard anything
so loud as the <i>boom</i> that broke not far
above his head soon afterward. At the
very moment when it looked as if Mr.
Nighthawk must dash himself to pieces
upon the ground, right where Chirpy
Cricket crouched and trembled, he had
spread his wings and checked his fall. It
was the air, rushing through his wing-feathers
with great force, that made the
queer, hollow sound. That was why Mr.
Nighthawk claimed that he made the
booming on a wind instrument.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he said, when he had settled
himself in the tree once more. &#8220;If you
think you can teach me to perform better,
just try that trick yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Chirpy Cricket said that he was
sure Mr. Nighthawk&#8217;s performance
couldn&#8217;t be bettered by anybody. And he
remarked that the noise reminded him of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
a high wind coming on top of a thunder
storm.</p>
<p>That pleased Mr. Nighthawk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the greatest praise I&#8217;ve ever had!&#8221;
he declared. And before Chirpy Cricket
knew what had happened, Mr. Nighthawk
had flown away.</p>
<p>Chirpy often wondered why he left so
suddenly. The truth was that Mr. Nighthawk
had hurried back to the woods to tell
his wife what Chirpy Cricket had said to
him. And ever afterward he was fond of
repeating Chirpy&#8217;s remark, in a boasting
way, until his neighbors were heartily
tired of hearing it.</p>

<h2>XXII</h2>
<h3>HARMLESS MR. MEADOW MOUSE</h3>
</div>

<p>One night when Chirpy Cricket was fiddling
his prettiest, not far from the fence
between the farmyard and the meadow, he
had a queer feeling, as if somebody were
gazing at him. And glancing up quickly,
he saw that a plump person sat on a fence-rail,
busily engaged in staring at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How-dy do!&#8221; Chirpy Cricket piped;
for the fat, four-legged person looked both
cheerful and harmless. &#8220;I take it you&#8217;re
fond of music.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger, whose name was Mr.
Meadow Mouse, smiled. &#8220;I won&#8217;t dispute
your statement,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you play some instrument
yourself,&#8221; Chirpy observed.</p>
<p>But Mr. Meadow Mouse shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he replied. &#8220;No! To tell the
truth, I haven&#8217;t much time for that sort of
thing. Besides, it seems to me somewhat
dangerous. I was wondering, while I
watched you, whether you weren&#8217;t likely
to fiddle yourself into bits&mdash;you were
working so hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket assured him that there
wasn&#8217;t the least danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;All my family are famous fiddlers,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve never heard of such an
accident happening to any of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse appeared to be
slightly disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I could pick up
the pieces for you, in case you fell apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dark as he was, Chirpy Cricket almost
turned pale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you weren&#8217;t intending to&mdash;to
swallow the pieces, were you?&#8221; he stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! No!&#8221; Mr. Meadow Mouse
gasped. &#8220;I&#8217;m what&#8217;s known as a vegetarian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, when he heard that, Chirpy
Cricket made ready to jump out of the
stranger&#8217;s way. He didn&#8217;t know what a
vegetarian was; but it sounded terrible to
him.</p>
<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse must have guessed
that Chirpy was uneasy. Anyhow, he
hastened to explain that a vegetarian was
one that ate only food that grew on plants
of one kind or another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I live for the most part on seeds and
grain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So you see I&#8217;m quite
harmless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket told him that he was
glad to know it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a vegetarian myself,&#8221; he added
proudly, &#8220;for I eat blades of grass. And
you see I&#8217;m harmless too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse bestowed another
fat smile on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it must be quite safe
for me to stay here and talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket didn&#8217;t know why the
plump gentleman was smiling, unless it
was because he felt easy in his mind.
Chirpy couldn&#8217;t help liking him, he was so
friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll play my favorite tune for you, if
you wish,&#8221; Chirpy offered, being eager to
do something pleasant for his new acquaintance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do!&#8221; said Mr. Meadow Mouse. &#8220;And
make it as lively as you please. For I&#8217;ve
just dined well and I&#8217;m in a very cheerful
mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Chirpy Cricket began his <i>cr-r-r-i!</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
<i>cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!</i> while Mr. Meadow Mouse
moved nearer and watched him closely.
After a time he began to fidget. And at
last he asked Chirpy if he wouldn&#8217;t please
be still for a moment, because there was
something he wanted to say.</p>
<p>Chirpy stopped fiddling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I notice,&#8221; said Mr. Meadow Mouse,
&#8220;that you&#8217;re having some trouble tuning
up your fiddle. So if you don&#8217;t mind I&#8217;ll
go over in the cornfield on a matter of business
and come back here later. Then, no
doubt, you&#8217;ll be all ready to play a tune
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket had to explain that he
had been playing a tune all the time&mdash;that
he always played on one note.</p>
<p>So Mr. Meadow Mouse stayed and heard
more of the fiddling. He begged Chirpy&#8217;s
pardon for his mistake. And he said that
if he only had a fiddle he should like to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
learn the same tune himself. &#8220;Although,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;it must be very difficult to play
always on the same note. It must take a
great deal of practice.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
<h2>XXIII</h2>
<h3>A WAIL IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>

<p>There was an odd cry that often interrupted
the nightly concerts of the Cricket
family. Chirpy Cricket had never heard
it in the daytime. But when twilight began
to wrap Pleasant Valley in its shadows,
the strange, wailing call was almost
sure to come quavering through the air.
Somehow it always sent a shiver over
Chirpy. And sometimes it made him lose
a few notes&mdash;if he happened to be fiddling
when he heard it.</p>
<p>He learned that it was a dangerous bird
known as Simon Screecher&mdash;a cousin of
Solomon Owl&mdash;that made this uncanny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
call. If he had lived, like Solomon, across
the meadow in the hemlock woods, Chirpy
Cricket would have paid less heed to the
noise he made. But Simon Screecher had
his home in a hollow apple tree in Farmer
Green&#8217;s orchard.</p>
<p>It was said&mdash;by those that claimed to
know&mdash;that Simon Screecher slept in the
daytime. But every tiny night-creature&mdash;the
Katydids and the Crickets and all the
rest&mdash;knew that after sunset Simon
Screecher was as wide awake as anybody.</p>
<p>It was no wonder that Chirpy Cricket
was always uneasy when Simon screeched
his warning that he was awake and looking
for his supper. Chirpy knew that he
could not depend on Simon to stay long
in one place. Though you heard his
screech in the orchard one moment, you
might see him in the farmyard soon afterward.
He never ate a whole meal in just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
one spot, but preferred to move about
wherever his fancy took him. Simon
himself said that he could eat off and on all
night long, if he kept moving.</p>
<p>Somehow Mr. Meadow Mouse had heard
of this saying of Simon Screecher&#8217;s.
&#8220;You ought to crawl into your hole under
the straw whenever Simon Screecher is
about the neighborhood,&#8221; he advised
Chirpy one evening, when the two chanced
to meet near the fence.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Simon is around here every
night,&#8221; Chirpy replied. &#8220;If I stayed at
home from dusk till dawn I couldn&#8217;t take
part in another concert all summer long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse said that that would
be a great pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose&#8221;&mdash;Chirpy asked
him hopefully&mdash;&#8220;don&#8217;t you suppose I
could jump out of Simon Screecher&#8217;s
reach if he tried to catch me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You could find out by trying,&#8221; said
Mr. Meadow Mouse.</p>
<p>So Chirpy Cricket began to feel more
cheerful. He even fiddled a bit, thinking
that he had no special reason to worry.
And then all at once he stopped making
music.</p>
<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse had been searching
about on the ground for seeds, while he
was enjoying Chirpy&#8217;s fiddling. And
when the music came to a sudden end he
looked up and saw that something was
troubling the fiddler.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;An unpleasant idea has just come into
my head,&#8221; Chirpy told him. &#8220;It would
be very unlucky for me if I found that I
wasn&#8217;t spry enough to escape Simon
Screecher!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse had to admit that
there was a good deal of truth in Chirpy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
remark. But he said he was ready with
another suggestion. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good one,
too,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Chirpy asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to think of some other
way&#8221;&mdash;said Mr. Meadow Mouse&mdash;&#8220;some
other way of being safe from Simon
Screecher.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XXIV</h2>
<h3>FRIGHTENING SIMON SCREECHER</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse acted as if he thought
he had been a great help when he said that
Chirpy Cricket would have to think of
another way to avoid Simon Screecher&#8217;s
cruel talons. But the more Chirpy turned
the matter over in his mind the further he
seemed to be from any plan. For several
days and nights he puzzled over his problem.
And every time he heard Simon
Screecher&#8217;s unearthly wail he shivered so
hard that his fiddling actually seemed to
shiver too.</p>
<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse inquired regularly
whether Chirpy had hit upon any plan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
And at last Mr. Meadow Mouse announced
that he would have to think of one himself.
So he sat down and looked very wise,
while Chirpy Cricket fiddled for him, because
Mr. Meadow Mouse explained that
his wits always worked better when somebody
made music for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you notice his cry a little while
ago?&#8221; Mr. Meadow Mouse asked. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
you notice how his voice trembled?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; Chirpy said. &#8220;Yes! Now that
you speak of it, I remember that his voice
shook a good deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Mr. Meadow Mouse exclaimed.
&#8220;Something had frightened him. Now,
you had just begun to fiddle before he cried
out. And there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind
that your music scared Simon Screecher.
So all you need do to feel safe from him
is to fiddle a plenty every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket felt so happy all at once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
that he began a lively tune. And sure
enough! Simon Screecher squalled almost
immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;That proves it!&#8221; Mr. Meadow Mouse
exclaimed. And then he said good evening
and ran off to the place where
Farmer Green had been threshing oats,
feeling very well pleased with himself.</p>
<p>Chirpy Cricket took pains to follow
Mr. Meadow Mouse&#8217;s advice. And neither
Simon Screecher&mdash;nor his cousin Solomon
Owl&mdash;troubled Chirpy all the rest of the
summer. He fiddled the nights away with
more pleasure than ever before. And by
the time fall came all his neighbors agreed
that he had done even more than his part
to make the summer gay for everybody.</p>
